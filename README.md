# Top-Resume-Screener-Using-NLP

## Dataset
Resume Parser aims to speed up screening process of a candidate.
In the recruitment process, it is inefficient, slow, and costly to scan with hundreds of
resumes one by one based on the skill-set. Resume parser automates the screening.
Resume parsing is tricky. There are hundreds of ways of doing it.
Our Resume screener aims to speed up screening process of a candidate. Given a
bulk of resumes, a Resume Screener outputs the top N candidates for the described
role.

We used 3 resume datasets
Training Dataset:

– The training dataset if from kaggle
– Data is CSV format
– https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset?select=data

– https://www.kaggle.com/code/gauravduttakiit/resume-screening-using-machine-learning/data


Test Dataset:
– Test dataset is from a git repository

– https://github.com/florex/resume_corpus

– The dataset has PDF format of resumes grouped by job category
